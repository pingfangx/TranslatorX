        The Move refactorings allow you to move files, directories, class members and declarations within a project. CLion tracks these movements and automatically corrects all references to the moved symbols in the source code.</p>
    <p>CLion also tracks the dependencies between members and warns you about possible issues it detects.</p>
    <p>To apply the refactoring select a file or a directory in the Project tool window, select a class member, a class or a declaration in the Editor or Structure view, and press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:Move;</span>
        (<span class="control">Refactor | Move</span>).</p>
